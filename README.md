## User Story

* As a user, I want to have an easy access with global data.

* As a user, I want to see the average number between 1990 - 2013.

* As a user, I want to see the average by gender (Both, Male, Female).

* As a user, I want to distinguish the color of map by the gender (Green, Blue, Pink) (right top of the page).

* As a user, I want to zoom in the map to browse countries.

## Project Description

by gender (either both, male, or female). The color of map will change depend on the gender to distinguish the data between gender.
